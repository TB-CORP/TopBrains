# Feedback-based Weekly Trainings (FWT)
Feedback-based Weekly Trainings (FWT) is training approach, which allows a company's employee to train based on feedback of others. The purpose of this approach is to not do the same mistakes in terms of work and study to fill the actual and real gaps in employees knowledge. This training system can only be applied to IT department, since it was written by CTO, who is primarily qualified in IT layer of business.

## Organization
Trainings are also tasks, so they follow the same rules as regular tasks according to [IT Department Task Management](./it-department-task-management.md). However, there are few differences between a training and a task, first, training are being done out of work hours, second, trainings are not organized in the same location as work related tasks. Besides these differences, trainings and tasks are pretty similar in organization.
## Feedback
Feedback in the approach's context is a personal opinion of a particular employee about work of other employee, which is presented in a form of personal suggestion of what to study to make that other employee to know or grow. Feedback can only be scoped within the qualification of a commentator and can only be expressed with logic and existing statistic about that other employee.
### Leaving
To leave a feedback a person should understand what are [Feedback](#feedback) and [Organization](#organization) of the approach, and [IT Department Task Management](./it-department-task-management.md). Leaving feedback is done in `Main` list of the IT Department space within the ClickUp application. When you open the list you see team statuses (e.g. Management, Design, etc.) in each you find a task name like `FWT YYYY-MM-DD` (or create if there is no such task), there you should leave a comment with the list of studies recommendation (e.g. `How to test design libraries`) and pin assignee to that task, who is a employee to whom this list is dedicated. If you want to expand that list for that particular employee leave a new comment. If your feedback is not being canceled (see [Arguing](#arguing)), then in the end of current work week, it will be proceed (see [Proceeding](#proceeding)).
### Arguing
If you are an employee to whom a feedback was leaved and you don't agree with it, you can argue with the commentator about it out of work hours. Arguing should can only accept arguments, which are based on logic and existing statistic. There are few possible scenarios during arguing:
1. You accept that feedback - in that case nothing changes;
2. The commenter agree with you - in that case the commenter should delete the feedback or modify it;
3. You and the commenter couldn't agree on one - the final decision is being applied by the team leader of employee to whom the feedback was leaved or CTO.
Arguing should be done before the feedback is proceed (see [Proceeding](#proceeding)).
### Proceeding
In the end of current work week, all leaved feedbacks are being converted to trainings, which are located in the `Training` list of the IT Department space by team leaders or CTO. Trainings should be studied out of work hours and reason for that is employees, who received trainings made certain mistakes in their work, which may be repeatedly damage the company and during work hours other feedback is being collected. Trainings should not be regarded as a punishment, it's another bonus for employees to become a better specialists faster without them manually analyzing their work themselves, which is in most cases doesn't lead to an actual problem.
