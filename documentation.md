# Documentation
Documentation is a set of articles whose material has been officially approved by the IT department management intended to describe, explain or instruct the technical or other related aspects of the TopBrains project. This article serves as the root navigation of the project documentation. Documentation articles about specific project entities should be in the repositories of those entities if the context of those articles does not imply the TopBrains as a whole.
